	<label>by: Edgar Allan Poe</label>
</div>
<br>
<div id="poem">
<p>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,</p>
<p>Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—</p>
<p>While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,</p>
<p>As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.</p>
<p>“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—</p>
<p> Only this and nothing more.”</p>
<br>
<p>Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;</p>
<p>And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.</p>
<p>Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow</p>
<p>From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—</p>
<p>For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—</p>
<p>Nameless <label id="here">here</label> for evermore.</p>
<br>
<p>And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain</p>
<p>Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;</p>
<p>So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating</p>
<p>“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—</p>
<p>Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—</p>
<p>This it is and nothing more.”</p>
<br>
<p>Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,</p>
<p>“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;</p>
<p>But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,</p>
<p>And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,</p>
<p>That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—</p>
<p>Darkness there and nothing more.</p>
<br>
<p>Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,</p>
<p>Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;</p>
<p>But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,</p>
<p>And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”</p>
<p>This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—</p>
<p>Merely this and nothing more.</p>
<br>
<p>Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,</p>
<p>Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.</p>
<p>“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;</p>
<p>Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—</p>
<p>Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—</p>
<p>’Tis the wind and nothing more!”</p>
<br>
<p>Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,</p>
<p>In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;</p>
<p>Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;</p>
<p>But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—</p>
<p>Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—</p>
<p>Perched, and sat, and nothing more.</p>
<br>
<p>Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,</p>
<p>By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,</p>
<p>“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,</p>
<p>Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—</p>
<p>Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”</p>
<p>Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”</p>
<br>
<p>Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,</p>
<p>Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;</p>
<p>For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being</p>
<p>Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—</p>
<p>Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,</p>
<p>With such name as “Nevermore.”</p>
<br>
<p>But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only</p>
<p>That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.</p>
<p>Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—</p>
<p>Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—</p>
<p>On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”</p>
<p>Then the bird said “Nevermore.”</p>
<br>
<p>Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,</p>
<p>“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store</p>
<p>Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster</p>
<p>Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—</p>
<p>Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore</p>
<p>Of ‘Never—nevermore’.”</p>
<br>
<p>But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,</p>
<p>Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;</p>
<p>Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking</p>
<p>Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—</p>
<p>What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore</p>
<p>Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”</p>
<br>
<p>This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing</p>
<p>To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;</p>
<p>This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining</p>
<p>On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,</p>
<p>But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,</p>
<p>She shall press, ah, nevermore!</p>
<br>
<p>Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer</p>
<p>Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.</p>
<p>“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee</p>
<p>Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;</p>
<p>Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”</p>
<p>Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”</p>
<br>
<p>“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—</p>
<p>Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,</p>
<p>Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—</p>
<p>On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—</p>
<p>Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”</p>
<p>Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”</p>
<br>
<p>“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!</p>
<p>By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—</p>
<p>Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,</p>
<p>It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—</p>
<p>Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”</p>
<p>Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”</p>
<br>
<p> “Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—</p>
<p>“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!</p>
<p>Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!</p>
<p>Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!</p>
<p>Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”</p>
<p>Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”</p>
<br>
<p>And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, <label id="here">still</label> is sitting</p>
<p>On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;</p>
<p>And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,</p>
<p>And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;</p>
<p>And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor</p>
<p>Shall be lifted—nevermore!</p>
